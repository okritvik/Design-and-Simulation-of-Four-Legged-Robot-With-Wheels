Changelog for package hardware_interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.19.5 (2021-06-16)
-------------------
* Correct exception msg for missing abs pos ptr
* fix broken links by making them relative
* Contributors: G.A. vd. Hoorn, Mikael Arguedas

0.19.4 (2020-12-05)
-------------------
* Clarified documentation for InterfaceManager sub-manager handling
* Updated InterfaceManager documentation
* Removed duplicate error message
  Previously, trying to combine two non-ResourceManager interfaces yielded
  two identical error messages.
* Remove inconsistent InterfaceManager manager registering behavior
  All InterfaceManager now handle registered InterfaceManagers
  transparently. This allows chains of multiple InterfaceManagers
  registered to each other to work corectly, mostly relevant for
  registering a manager from a combined_robot_hw RobotHW.

* Add sensor reference frame field.
* First draft of sensor interfaces.
  - Force/torque (wrench)

  - IMU (very crude approximation)

0.4.0 (2013-06-25)
------------------
* Version 0.4.0
* 1.0.1
* Add another convenience symbol demangling method.
  We already had:
  string foo_name = demangledTypeName<FooType>();
  which works great for typenames, but we were missing the equivalent for specific
  instances:
  FooType foo;
  string foo_name = demangledTypeName(foo);
  ...which works well for polymorphic types, returning the derived-most name.
* Fix duplicate header guard.
* Fix package URL in package.xml
* Fix compiler warning (-Wreorder).
* Restore documentation of handle parameters.
  Documentation that was previously in the interface classes before the
  hardware interface rework has been moved to the handle classes.
* Fix ResourceManager exception messages.
  - Print derived class name instead of the less descriptive and more cryptic
  base class name. Eg.
  "hardware_interface::JointCommandInterface"
  instead of
  "hardware_interface::ResourceManager<hardware_interface::JointStateHandle>"
* Trivial doc/whitespace fix.
* Merge branch 'master' into hardware_interface_rework
  Conflicts:
  hardware_interface/CMakeLists.txt
* Separate resource manager in two classes.
  - Refs `#45 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/45>`_.
  - HardwareInterface specifics (ie. resource claiming) has been factored out.
  We now have the non-polymorphic ResourceManager class for registering and
  getting handles, and the polymorphic HardwareResourceManager that
  additionally implements the HardwareInterface and takes care of resource
  claiming.
  - The above change is required if the transmission interface is to leverage
  the resource management code, but without the hardware interface specifics.
  - Move files back to the internal folder. They are building blocks of the
  public API of hardware interfaces, but should not be directly #included
  by end users, so it's best they don't share the same location as
  user-facing headers.
  - Update unit tests.
* Add missing include statement.
* Validate raw data wrapped by hardware interfaces.
  - Refs `#47 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/47>`_ and `#52 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/52>`_.
  - Initialize raw data pointers to 0 in default handle constructors, otherwise
  they evaluate to nonzero and there is no way to distinguish an uninitialized
  state (ie. dangling pointers) from a properly initialized one.
  - For non-empty handle constructors, validate input raw data, throw if invalid
  pointers are found.
  - Add assertions on handle accessors. Invalid reads will trigger the assertions
  instead of causing a segfault (in debug mode).
  - Update unit tests.
* Warn when replacing a handle/interface.
  It is legitimate to change the underlying data associated to a handle/interface
  name, but it might also be a common programming error. Having the logs reflect
  this situation would allow to spot it easily.
* Make error message more explicit in test.
  Output with ROS_ERROR_STREAM instead of std::cout
* Add RobotHW class test.
* Add virtual destructor, protected internals.
  - ResourceManager inherits from HardwareInterface, which has virtual methods,
  so a virtual destructor is required.
  - Internal members are protected instead of private.
* Unit test hardware_interfaces.
* More uniform hardware_interface API. Refs  `#45 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/45>`_.
* adding install targets
* Restore joint resource claiming!.
  It had been mistakenly removed in a previous commit.
* merging CMakeLists.txt files from rosbuild and catkin
* adding hybrid-buildsystem makefiles
* Fix package URLs.
* Fix exception throwing.
* Harmonize how variables are quoted in logs.
  - Unify to using 'single quotes'.
  - Fixes `#42 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/42>`_.
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/willowgarage/ros_control
  Conflicts:
  hardware_interface/include/hardware_interface/joint_command_interface.h
* Add explicit actuator hardware interfaces.
  - These classes are similar to the existing joint equivalents, and are useful
  in setups leveraging the transmission_interface.
* Refactor named resource management code.
  - In preparation for the explicitly typed actuators interface, code for managing
  named resources has been refactored into a separate class. This code consists
  of convenience methods wrapping a std::map container, and occur often enough
  that factoring it out to prevent duplication makes sense.
  - Code that is not part of the public API, and hence with no stability guarantees
  has been moved to the internal folder/namespace. It only affects the named
  resource management and symbol demanglind methods so far.
* catkinizing, could still be cleaned up
* add accessor for command
* Remove redundant semicolons.
* Use demangled type names when available. Fixes `#36 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/ros_control/issues/36>`_.
  Type names are used in different interfaces  such as hardware_interface and
  controller_interface. When symbol demangling is available (currently gcc 3.0+),
  operate on demangled names, as they are more convenient for human reading, eg.
  hardware_interface::VelocityJointInterface
  instead of
  N18hardware_interface22VelocityJointInterfaceE
* Fix typo in rosdoc config files.
* Fixing error message in JointCommandInterface
* More documentation in hardware_interface
* Adding template parameter doc
* Changing @ commands to \ commands
